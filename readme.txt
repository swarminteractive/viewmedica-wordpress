# ViewMedica 9 for WordPress

Instantly embed your ViewMedica On-Demand in to your website

=== Description ===

This plugin is to help embed the ViewMedica&reg; Patient Education system on your WordPress site. It will help prevent WYSIWYG editors from stripping out script and HTML code that is required by your ViewMedica embed. You can also generate a full patient education section on your site in seconds!

**Instantly Embed ViewMedica**

The ViewMedica plugin for WordPress adds a button to the WYSIWG editor which allows you to instantly embed any video in your account. Simply click the button, select your video and press Embed.

**Create a page with links to your ViewMedica content**

Use the plugin’s Page Generator to instantly make a Web page that features all of your ViewMedica videos. You can choose to show your video links in list form, or with a thumbnail image and description.

**Change ViewMedica player settings globally**

The Global Options settings change the behavior of ViewMedica across your entire site. Set things like your player width, default language and other features.

**Change player settings for a single embed**

The Inline Options settings give you control of individual ViewMedica embeds on your site. For example, you may want to disable menu access on a page so your users only see one specific video. Checkout the Shortcode Generator to see the options available, or head to a post and use our inline tool.

=== Installation ===

Visit the plugin's administration page by navigating to Settings then ViewMedica. First, you will need to enter your ViewMedica client ID. You can find your Client ID by logging into your account at ViewMedica.com
